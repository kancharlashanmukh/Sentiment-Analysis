We had already eaten so we're just stopping for drinks before a concert down the street at Mod Club. Had no issues getting a table Both my cocktails were delicious and well balanced. They had just released their fall menu. I had a gin based and bourbon based one. Good selection and variety. Service was excellent. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly- gave us just the right amount of attention. Ambience was great - gold and emerald touches and white and plants balancing that. Comfortable booths and chairs. Stools also looked good - which is an important thing to get right. Tip- they had a happy hour until 8pm where your second cocktail was 1/2 price! Also we were told they have a comedy night each Tuesday. The food surrounding tables were getting looked delicious- so I'd love to come back and review that!\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bzG-L-LEjCwotAJGPCBJug/168s.jpg'}]\n",

I got the one menu item that I wanted to try so I don't think I would come back here for brunch (I always like to try new things). I got the pork belly benny and bf got the noodle bowl. He didn't love the noodles that came with the bowl, which were vermicelli noodles but I'm sure the restaurant considered intolerance to gluten in their choice. He said the chicken was well seasoned and the half spring roll was good. My pork belly benny was great- the pork belly wasn't too fatty at all.

It's more than snacks and drinks.The spot itself is not very big but it delivers all you need on the cute factor. \\xa0Lots of nice light and an airy feel with the plants that is throughout the dining area. \\xa0The service here is really friendly... casual but it fits the spot. \\xa0It's like a nice friend inviting you into their kitchen.As for the menu, it's not a big one but well curated to find something for everything. \\xa0I like how there's a bit of influence globally on the dishes... it's not your typical North American dishes. \\xa0And plating here is definitely a step up above any neighbourhood spot. \\xa0Salmon and Egg Toast - What an amazing presentation. \\xa0Normally you have it arrived stacked or haphazardly. \\xa0This one is beautifully laid out and lots of great ingredients to make your bite the way you want. \\xa0I think everything was perfectly cooked ... molten egg yolk, toasted crunchy bread, and just thoughtful in the spices to keep it good. \\xa0if anything, I think they could have bolder with the spices. \\xa0 4/5French Toast - Another beautifully laid out dish. \\xa0Its just eye catching. \\xa0With this one, fluffy thick toasts are doused in custard and the pan fried nicely to get crisp edges. \\xa0I loved how this was done... lightly flavoured and they could pushed the boundaries more on the flavour. \\xa04/5Overall, great spot for moments at the bar but more so for the food. \\xa0Dont think this is just a bar... totally wrong. \\xa0Food is worth the detour here.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SLKJaHGixKr-8y8r2fqd1g/168s.jpg'}]\n",

Our server was knowledgeable and friendly- gave us just the right amount of attention. Ambience was great - gold and emerald touches and white and plants balancing that.

To be frank, I found this place from the gram based on photos of their food, but I really really liked the vibe in the restaurant itself. It's small but not crowded. We had the Salmon tartare with umami sauce, egg, and nori. The sauce was excellent and I wish there were more slices of mini toasts. The pork belly eggs benny was quite delicious as well. It came with a side of romaine lettuce greens (not bad) and the usual poached egg, hollandaise sauce, maple pork belly, and a potato emulsion. The maple pork belly was delicious, could have more maple syrup though. Sauce had a good texture and consistency but nothing fancy or different. We also ordered a side of maple pork belly which was so darn amazing. So I guess the eggs benny would have been much better if they had more maple syrup and more meat hehe. I guess that's why we ordered more meat xD Coffee came in a cute and tiny \\xa0French press. Overall, I loved this brunch place. It's super cute and I loved the vibe .

To be frank, I found this place from the gram based on photos of their food, but I really really liked the vibe in the restaurant itself. It's small but not crowded. We had the Salmon tartare with umami sauce, egg, and nori. The sauce was excellent and I wish there were more slices of mini toasts. The pork belly eggs benny was quite delicious as well. It came with a side of romaine lettuce greens (not bad) and the usual poached egg, hollandaise sauce, maple pork belly, and a potato emulsion. The maple pork belly was delicious, could have more maple syrup though. Sauce had a good texture and consistency but nothing fancy or different. We also ordered a side of maple pork belly which was so darn amazing. So I guess the eggs benny would have been much better if they had more maple syrup and more meat hehe. I guess that's why we ordered more meat xD Coffee came in a cute and tiny \\xa0French press. Overall, I loved this brunch place. It's super cute and I loved the vibe .

I cannot comment on the service or food, but I tried a couple of cocktails and they were all good. The place is very cute with real plants on the wall and nice lighting.

Not only are the walls and windows lined with cute greenery from their wall of plants, there are also cozy booth seats with cute marble tables and wooden high top tables. To be frank, I found this place from the gram based on photos of their food, but I really really liked the vibe in the restaurant itself. It's small but not crowded. We had the Salmon tartare with umami sauce, egg, and nori. The sauce was excellent and I wish there were more slices of mini toasts. The pork belly eggs benny was quite delicious as well. It came with a side of romaine lettuce greens (not bad) and the usual poached egg, hollandaise sauce, maple pork belly, and a potato emulsion. The maple pork belly was delicious, could have more maple syrup though. Sauce had a good texture and consistency but nothing fancy or different. We also ordered a side of maple pork belly which was so darn amazing. So I guess the eggs benny would have been much better if they had more maple syrup and more meat hehe. I guess that's why we ordered more meat xD Coffee came in a cute and tiny \\xa0French press. Overall, I loved this brunch place. It's super cute and I loved the vibe . It's a little bit noisy since it's a smaller space but we were lucky our seat was in the corner by the window , so a little bit away from everyone else :)\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2OYUjyyz4yokMiF3C7evLA/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '4', 'Comments': 'The ambience of this place just screams insta gram worthy. The decors are super cute and the atmosphere (we were there for dinner) was amazing. Our waitress was super enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu which added to the experience. We got many dishes to share such as: dumplings, takoyaki, duck skewers, chicken wings, chicken popcorn, katsu sandwich. My favourite would have to be the takoyaki and katsu sandwich while my least was the chicken popcorn. The drinks were great while the dishes were on the pricier side considering the portion size and the taste. However, I would love to come back and try their brunch menu!'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': \"Very cozy little restobar. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Food is absolutely amazing. We ordered the Bad and Bougie French Toast and the Ol' Town Road Chicken and Waffles. Portion size was perfect for brunch. French toast was nice and fluffy. Chicken was juicy. And BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS! Highly recommended and will absolutely come back.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xEVdmVcq0wdPXRM_wFX20A/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '4', 'Comments': \"Came to Pray Tell, frankly, to look at the plants. Got a great dining experience and delicious food! The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Even though it looks like a pretentious brunch place, the staff were anything but. I would say that the brunch menu is somewhat limited, hence the one star off. I got the one menu item that I wanted to try so I don't think I would come back here for brunch (I always like to try new things). I got the pork belly benny and bf got the noodle bowl. He didn't love the noodles that came with the bowl, which were vermicelli noodles but I'm sure the restaurant considered intolerance to gluten in their choice. He said the chicken was well seasoned and the half spring roll was good. My pork belly benny was great- the pork belly wasn't too fatty at all. Salad was crisp and the dressing was sweet-ish but I couldn't quite place the flavour.\"}, {'Rating': '2', 'Comments': 'Very pretty spot. Calcatta tile, brass decor, natural green draped wall, excellent presentation. Food quality and selection is even more limited than the menu. Pork belly was more like pork chop.

It's more than snacks and drinks.The spot itself is not very big but it delivers all you need on the cute factor. \\xa0Lots of nice light and an airy feel with the plants that is throughout the dining area. \\xa0The service here is really friendly... casual but it fits the spot. \\xa0It's like a nice friend inviting you into their kitchen.As for the menu, it's not a big one but well curated to find something for everything. \\xa0I like how there's a bit of influence globally on the dishes... it's not your typical North American dishes. \\xa0And plating here is definitely a step up above any neighbourhood spot. \\xa0Salmon and Egg Toast - What an amazing presentation. \\xa0Normally you have it arrived stacked or haphazardly. \\xa0This one is beautifully laid out and lots of great ingredients to make your bite the way you want. \\xa0I think everything was perfectly cooked ... molten egg yolk, toasted crunchy bread, and just thoughtful in the spices to keep it good. \\xa0if anything, I think they could have bolder with the spices. \\xa0 4/5French Toast - Another beautifully laid out dish. \\xa0Its just eye catching. \\xa0With this one, fluffy thick toasts are doused in custard and the pan fried nicely to get crisp edges. \\xa0I loved how this was done... lightly flavoured and they could pushed the boundaries more on the flavour. \\xa04/5Overall, great spot for moments at the bar but more so for the food. \\xa0Dont think this is just a bar... totally wrong. \\xa0Food is worth the detour here.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SLKJaHGixKr-8y8r2fqd1g/168s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': 'The ambiance is what makes this place nice, but the attention to detail makes Pray Tell absolutely special to share with your friends and family.

It was tasty- very buttery and crunchy. I unfortunately did not taste the strawberry which was somewhat disappointing.The pork belly wasn't too fat which I liked. The meat was marinated in an interesting flavour that makes the overall Benedict very tasty. The healthy salad compliments the fatty pork belly! I found the portion to be slightly small which isn't as filling as other places. But can't complain!

This small place has a cute wall filled with plants and is a great place to meet up with friends for some drinks or snacks. I dropped by Pray Tell on a Sunday for brunch at around 12pm and had a great relaxing meal.My boyfriend and I ordered a tea and an americano for drinks and both were pleasantly very good. For our food I got the avo-toast with a side of sausage patties and my boyfriend got the short rib benny. Both were delicious and filling. No complaints!The service was friendly and attentive and the place was not very full so it was a nice leisurely brunch.
