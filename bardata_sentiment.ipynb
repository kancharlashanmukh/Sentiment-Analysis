      "This review is based on my experience last night (Saturday around 7:30pm). We had already eaten so we're just stopping for drinks before a concert down the street at Mod Club. Had no issues getting a table Both my cocktails were delicious and well balanced. They had just released their fall menu. I had a gin based and bourbon based one. Good selection and variety. Service was excellent. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly- gave us just the right amount of attention. Ambience was great - gold and emerald touches and white and plants balancing that. Comfortable booths and chairs. Stools also looked good - which is an important thing to get right. Tip- they had a happy hour until 8pm where your second cocktail was 1/2 price! Also we were told they have a comedy night each Tuesday. The food surrounding tables were getting looked delicious- so I'd love to come back and review that!\n",

      "This is one of those neighborhood spots where folks gather for a good time.  Truly with quite a few on Friday night standing and drinking, dancing as well this is that kind of a spot . Here you chill.It's not really easy to have a conversation with music and people standing all around you. For the food, we ordered the fries with Nori, popcorn chicken and out of the three, the carpaccio stood out. I can't say I would order them again. We also order the bougie dessert which was basically waffles and ice cream. Not really something that stood out.I can't say I would come here for food but for me the standouts were the cocktails especially Big Bud, Little Bud. Wonderful.  also recommend the Justice Beaver. It's a refreshing cocktail.Definitely, a standout are the drinks and customer service. Good for a night out!.\n",

      "Both me and my friend got the Pork Belly Eggs Benedict since it looked like the best item on the menu. And it definitely was really tasty! The eggs were cooked just right and the hollandaise sauce was really creamy. The pork belly seemed to be maple glazed and was very soft and tender. However since the slices were so thick and juicy, I found myself feeling a bit heavy after one of the two pieces. The salad definitely helped offset that thought. The salad had some bitter pieces but overall added a nice crunch to the meal. They also served some small complimentary lemon custard short bread dessert squares, which was a nice way to finish off the meal. The dish and decor here is SUPER aesthetics and cute as well!\n",

      "Yes this is a great instagram worthy spot with aesthetically pleasing decor and beautifully styled food. However we had a table for 12 that was reserved a week in advance and it took an hour for them to serve our food. My friends got the chicken and waffle but when it arrived the waffles were all cold and the chicken was dry. They also don't have many gluten free or vegan options. I had the vegan loco and they couldn't swap grains for any type of gluten free grain or rice. Instead I got a side salad. When the dish came it was super salty. My friends avocado toast was quite soggy. When asking about the calorie content of the food, the server was unable to provide any answers/detail. The service was slow and the quality of food and wait time was disappointing.\n",

The restaurant is small but we came on a saturday morning with a reservation for a group of 8 and it didn't seem too busy.I got the salmon and eggs and it was good. It wasn't really what I expected but the flavours really worked together. It wasn't super amazing though either. I think the charm of the restaurant is mostly in the vibe, but given the food isn't bad, I didn't mind it at all.\n",

      "If you're looking for a super chill brunch place with good vibes on College street, THIS is the place to go. Not only are the walls and windows lined with cute greenery from their wall of plants, there are also cozy booth seats with cute marble tables and wooden high top tables. To be frank, I found this place from the gram based on photos of their food, but I really really liked the vibe in the restaurant itself. It's small but not crowded. We had the Salmon tartare with umami sauce, egg, and nori. The sauce was excellent and I wish there were more slices of mini toasts. The pork belly eggs benny was quite delicious as well. It came with a side of romaine lettuce greens (not bad) and the usual poached egg, hollandaise sauce, maple pork belly, and a potato emulsion. The maple pork belly was delicious, could have more maple syrup though. Sauce had a good texture and consistency but nothing fancy or different. We also ordered a side of maple pork belly which was so darn amazing. So I guess the eggs benny would have been much better if they had more maple syrup and more meat hehe. I guess that's why we ordered more meat xD Coffee came in a cute and tiny  French press. Overall, I loved this brunch place. It's super cute and I loved the vibe . It's a little bit noisy since it's a smaller space but we were lucky our seat was in the corner by the window , so a little bit away from everyone else :)\n",

Our waitress was super enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu which added to the experience. We got many dishes to share such as: dumplings, takoyaki, duck skewers, chicken wings, chicken popcorn, katsu sandwich. My favourite would have to be the takoyaki and katsu sandwich while my least was the chicken popcorn. The drinks were great while the dishes were on the pricier side considering the portion size and the taste. However, I would love to come back and try their brunch menu!\n",

      "Came to Pray Tell, frankly, to look at the plants. Got a great dining experience and delicious food! The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Even though it looks like a pretentious brunch place, the staff were anything but. I would say that the brunch menu is somewhat limited, hence the one star off. I got the one menu item that I wanted to try so I don't think I would come back here for brunch (I always like to try new things). I got the pork belly benny and bf got the noodle bowl. He didn't love the noodles that came with the bowl, which were vermicelli noodles but I'm sure the restaurant considered intolerance to gluten in their choice. He said the chicken was well seasoned and the half spring roll was good. My pork belly benny was great- the pork belly wasn't too fatty at all. Salad was crisp and the dressing was sweet-ish but I couldn't quite place the flavour.\n",

      "Brunches are an indulgence... they're meant for late breakfast and often coupled with richer sauces and sweets that bounce on the borders of desserts.  Pray Tell does a beautiful job of keeping to that and brings you dishes of beautifully plated brunch items.I have been keeping tabs on this place for a while but my hesitation for coming here was because it calls itself a bar for the longest time.  Don't let that dissuade you like it did me.  This place does food ... and does it well.  It probably needs to rebrand itself to give it the light it deserves.  Gastrobar? It's more than snacks and drinks.The spot itself is not very big but it delivers all you need on the cute factor.  Lots of nice light and an airy feel with the plants that is throughout the dining area.  The service here is really friendly... casual but it fits the spot.  It's like a nice friend inviting you into their kitchen.As for the menu, it's not a big one but well curated to find something for everything.  I like how there's a bit of influence globally on the dishes... it's not your typical North American dishes.  And plating here is definitely a step up above any neighbourhood spot.  Salmon and Egg Toast - What an amazing presentation.  Normally you have it arrived stacked or haphazardly.  This one is beautifully laid out and lots of great ingredients to make your bite the way you want.  I think everything was perfectly cooked ... molten egg yolk, toasted crunchy bread, and just thoughtful in the spices to keep it good.  if anything, I think they could have bolder with the spices.   4/5French Toast - Another beautifully laid out dish.  Its just eye catching.  With this one, fluffy thick toasts are doused in custard and the pan fried nicely to get crisp edges.  I loved how this was done... lightly flavoured and they could pushed the boundaries more on the flavour.  4/5Overall, great spot for moments at the bar but more so for the food.  Dont think this is just a bar... totally wrong.  Food is worth the detour here.\n",

      "Tried the Pork Belly Benedict, it was one of the best bennies I've tried out there!We got some cookies topped with strawberry jam on the house to try. It was tasty- very buttery and crunchy. I unfortunately did not taste the strawberry which was somewhat disappointing.The pork belly wasn't too fat which I liked. The meat was marinated in an interesting flavour that makes the overall Benedict very tasty. The healthy salad compliments the fatty pork belly! I found the portion to be slightly small which isn't as filling as other places. But can't complain! Service is mediocre.\n",

The food was absolutely outstanding and every single thing starting for apps to share plates were fantastic. We had the Roasted Garlic, Cheezy Bread, Braised Ribs and Pork Dumplings, every single item was amazing!  For drinks we tried the Old Fashioned, Make Nice, the Rural Juror and End of the Road. My absolute fav was the Rural Juror (it's sweet) and Make Nice. I totally recommend trying this place out!

      "Pray Tell is located at the intersection of Ossington and College. This small place has a cute wall filled with plants and is a great place to meet up with friends for some drinks or snacks. I dropped by Pray Tell on a Sunday for brunch at around 12pm and had a great relaxing meal.My boyfriend and I ordered a tea and an americano for drinks and both were pleasantly very good. For our food I got the avo-toast with a side of sausage patties and my boyfriend got the short rib benny. Both were delicious and filling. No complaints!The service was friendly and attentive and the place was not very full so it was a nice leisurely brunch. Would return for more!\n",
